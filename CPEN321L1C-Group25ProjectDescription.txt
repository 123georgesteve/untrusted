Project Description
We wanted to add a new bonus level to Untrusted, and all the code is in the newly added file, soccer.jsx. Our implementation of startlevel function consists of:
moveEnemyPlayer, moveGoalie, map.startTimer, map.getPlayer().setPhoneCallback functions, and invocations of map.defineObject function to define invisibleWall, enemyPlayer, goalie, ball, and gate objects.  All of our team's contributions are found in soccer.jsx.
